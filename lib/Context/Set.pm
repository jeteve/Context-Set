=head1 NAME

Context::Set - A Contextual preference/configuration holder.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 INTRODUCTION

Context is a preference manager that aims at solving the problem of storing configuration properties accross
an ever growing collection of contexts that often characterises enterprise systems.

For instance, you might want to have a 'page colour' setting that is global to your system,
but allow users to choose their own if they want.

Additionally, you might want to allow your users to specifically define a page color when
they view a specific 'list of stuff' in your system. Or allow the system to specify a page color
for all lists, or a specific one to certain lists, but still allowing users to override that.

Multiplication of preferences and management of their priorities can cause a lot of confusion
and headaches. This module is an attempt to help you to keep those things tidy and in control.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To use Context, the best way is probably to use a Context::Set::Manager that will
keep your contexts tidy for you.

  my $cm = Context::Set::Manager->new();
  $cm->universe()->set_property('page.colour' , 'blue');

  my $users = $cm->restrict('users');
  $users->set_property('page.colour', 'green');

  my $user1 = $cm->restrict('users' , 1);
  $user1->set_property('page.colour' , 'red');


  $user1->get_property('page.colour'); # red

  my $user2 = $cm->restrict('users' , 2);
  $user2->get_property('page.colour') ; # green

  my $lists = $cm->restrict('lists');
  my $list1 = $cm->restrict->($lists, 1);

  my $u1l1 = $cm->unite($user1, list1);
  $u1l1->set_property('page.colour', 'purple');

  $u1l1->get_property('page.colour'); # purple

  my $u1l2 = $cm->unite($user1 , $cm->restrict('lists' , 2));
  $u1l2->get_property('page.colour') ; # red

=head1 METHODS


=head2 fullname

Returns the fully qualified name of this context. The fullname of a context identifies the context
in the UNIVERSE in a unique manner.

=head2 name

Returns the local name of this context. fullname is more useful.

=head2 has_property

Returns true if there is a property of this name in this context.

Usage:

 if( $this->has_property('pi') ){
    ...
 }

=head2 get_property

Gets the property that goes by the given name. Dies if no property with the given name can be found.

my $pi = $this->get_property('pi');

=head2 set_property

Sets the given property to the given value. Never dies.

Usage:

  $this->set_property('pi' , 3.14159 );
  $this->set_property('fibo', [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 20 ]);


=head2 unite

Returns the Context::Set::Union of this and the other context.

usage:

  my $u = $this->unite($other_context);

=head2 restrict

Produces a new Context::Set::Restriction of this one.

Usage:

  ## Restrict to all users.
  my $context = $this->restrict('users');

  ## Further restriction to user 1
  $context = $context->restrict('1');
